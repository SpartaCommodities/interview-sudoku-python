# Sudoku Validator

This is a python project using poetry. It can be run from the IDE, or from the CLI using `poetry run pytest` or its Windows counterpart.

We will solve the exercise together during the interview, but feel free to prepare and bring your own solution(s) and we'll work on a follow-up.

The purpose of the exercise is to pair and code something within the time limit, not finding the most performant solution, or judging your code structure and naming conventions.

## Behavior
Familiarise yourself with Sudoku rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku

## Structure
SudokuBoard contains a basic implementation of a board, and a placeholder method to validate their correctness.
